A CI/CD pipeline (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment) 
is a piece of equipment that is used for the continuous building, testing, 
and deployment of software by automating the processes. 

It is a means for the teams to integrate the code changes rapidly, 
automatically test them and deliver updates efficiently.
 
Teams are able to perform all these three operations 
frequently and automatically


CI:
Ensure that code from multiple developers is integrated and tested frequently.
Developers push code changes to a shared repository (e.g., Git).
Upon each push, automated builds and tests are triggered.

CD:
Fully automate the deployment of code to production after passing all tests.
After successful CI, code is deployed automatically to production 
without human intervention.
